# DeFillama Backtesting Dataset - Project Roadmap

## Project Vision
Build a robust, scalable historical dataset system for backtesting DeFi trading strategies using DeFillama PRO API data.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) üöÄ

### Goals
- Establish core infrastructure
- Validate API access and data quality
- Create minimal viable data pipeline

### Tasks
1. **API Integration**
   - [ ] Obtain and configure DeFillama PRO API key
   - [ ] Create API client with rate limiting
   - [ ] Test all required endpoints
   - [ ] Implement error handling and retries

2. **Data Storage Setup**
   - [ ] Initialize DuckDB database
   - [ ] Design schema for prices, pools, TVL
   - [ ] Set up Parquet file structure
   - [ ] Create data directories

3. **Basic Data Collection**
   - [ ] Fetch current prices for top 20 tokens
   - [ ] Collect 1 month historical data
   - [ ] Store in both raw JSON and Parquet
   - [ ] Validate data integrity

### Key Challenges
- **API Rate Limits**: Need to implement smart throttling
- **Data Volume**: Even 1 month √ó 20 tokens = significant data
- **Schema Design**: Must be flexible for future additions

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with small dataset to test pipeline
- Keep raw API responses for reprocessing
- Document all data transformations

## Phase 2: Historical Data Collection (Week 3-4) üìä

### Goals
- Backfill 1 year of historical data
- Expand token and pool coverage
- Implement data quality checks

### Tasks
1. **Bulk Historical Import**
   - [ ] Fetch 1 year history for top 100 tokens
   - [ ] Collect LP pool data (Uniswap V3, Curve)
   - [ ] Import protocol TVL timeseries
   - [ ] Process yields and APY data

2. **Data Validation Pipeline**
   - [ ] Implement price sanity checks
   - [ ] Detect and flag outliers
   - [ ] Cross-validate with multiple endpoints
   - [ ] Create data quality reports

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Parallelize API calls with asyncio
   - [ ] Implement caching layer
   - [ ] Optimize database indexes
   - [ ] Partition data by date/chain

### Key Challenges
- **Missing Historical Data**: Some tokens may lack complete history
- **API Credit Consumption**: Bulk fetching uses significant credits
- **Data Consistency**: Prices may differ across endpoints

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement checkpoint/resume for long imports
- Monitor API credit usage closely
- Keep detailed logs of all data issues

## Phase 3: Backtesting Framework (Week 5-6) üß™

   - [ ] LP pool entry/exit logic
   - [ ] Yield farming strategies
   - [ ] Risk management rules

3. **Performance Analytics**
   - [ ] Calculate returns and Sharpe ratio
   - [ ] Generate drawdown analysis
   - [ ] Create P&L attribution
   - [ ] Export results to CSV/JSON

### Key Challenges
- **Realistic Simulation**: Modeling actual market conditions
- **LP Complexity**: Impermanent loss calculations
- **Multi-asset Strategies**: Cross-chain considerations

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with simple strategies first
- Validate against known results
- Include conservative slippage estimates

## Phase 4: Visualization & Analysis (Week 7-8) üìà

### Goals

   - [ ] Implement strategy performance dashboard

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - [ ] Correlation analysis tools
   - [ ] Volatility surface visualization
   - [ ] Liquidity depth analysis
   - [ ] Cross-chain arbitrage detection

3. **Reporting System**
   - [ ] Automated daily reports
   - [ ] Strategy performance summaries
   - [ ] Data quality metrics
   - [ ] API usage tracking

### Key Challenges
- **Performance with Large Data**: Dashboards may be slow
- **Real-time Updates**: Keeping visualizations current
- **User Experience**: Making complex data accessible

### Risk Mitigation
- Use data aggregation for performance
- Implement progressive loading
- Provide export options for detailed analysis

## Phase 5: Production & Automation (Week 9-10) üè≠

### Goals

## Alternative Approaches to Consider

1. **Use The Graph Protocol** instead of DeFillama for on-chain data
2. **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB** instead of DuckDB for time-series
3. **Apache Airflow** for orchestration instead of custom scripts
4. **Kafka** for real-time data streaming
5. **Cloud deployment** (AWS/GCP) vs local development

## Next Immediate Steps

1. üöÄ Get DeFillama PRO API key
2. üìù Review and approve this roadmap
3. üíª Set up development environment
4. üß™ Create first test API call
5. üìä Fetch first historical price data
